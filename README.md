This is my first implementation of a base64 encoder/decoder.
It is written in C++. It doesn't encode files yet but only 
string of caraters given as arguments.

Usage:
	./main -e "string to encode in base64 format"
	or
	./main -d "TGEgbGkgbHUgbGUgbG8="


You are free to use it. If there are errors or things that may be 
optimised (i'm just a beginner), please let me know.
